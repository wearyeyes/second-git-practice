We have let go of this
Nature is no longer on our side
Fighting with it for so long
We eventually wither and die
Struggle has become part of our everyday life
Digging deeper and deeper into rust
Sifting through their ashes
The dead have turned to dust
Multiple realities existing in singularity
A paradox of consequence and unfamiliarity
